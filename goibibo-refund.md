After I made this booking, I made a request in GoIbibo's website to change the last name of the traveller `Shahedah Rayees Mohammad` from `Mohammad` to `Shaikh`. I got a call from GoIbibo's customer support agent named `Ashish Kumar` who told me that the last name change is not possible but as the request is under 4 hours of booking, we can cancel the tickets for only 1 traveller `Shahedah Rayees Mohammad` in both the travels and I will get a full refund for those tickets with only convenience fees charged which would be around `₹690`. He asked me to book 2 tickets for both to and fro travel for only `Shahedah Rayees` again with the correct last name (`Shaikh`) and he asked me for the PNR of that booking. Then he told me he is contacting the airline and will now cancel the earlier tickets for `Shahedah Rayees Mohammad` in both PNRs `HTTG4T` and `PUSLRG` and issue full refund for the same as promised.

Below are the details of the new booking.

I was on call with the GoIbibo customer support agent `Ashish Kumar` intermittently for multiple hours while he was saying he was cancelling the said tickets with full refund. Later he called and said that the ticket for 1 traveller `Shahedah Rayees` in PNR `PUSLRG` was cancelled successfully and I will get a full refund but the ticket for 1 traveller `Shahedah Rayees` in PNR `HTTG4T` was mistakenly cancelled for both from the Indigo airlines side. He told me that he requested for only 1 travellers cancellation with full refund but the airlines cancelled both and asked me wait and that the airlines will correct the mistake and uncancel my ticket within 24 hours.


I waited and called the airlines next day (14th December 2023) and asked them. The Indigo airlines support agent said that it was no fault from their side and that the agent `Ashish Kumar` requested them to cancel both the tickets and thus they did so. He said that all call recordings are in place and GoIbibo is responsible for this and they will refund.


Later I have contacted multiple customer support agents of GoIbibo since 14th December 2023. I have also booked another ticket for traveller `Asif Ali Mohammad` as the ticket in PNR `HTTG4T` for this traveller was wrongfully cancelled. The PNR of the ticket I booked later for myself is `H47MQE`. I have been on call with multiple support agents for multiple hours and many tickets have been raised but with no solution at all. I was told that the call recordings will be checked and I would be refunded the amount rightfully but I have not been.


The current GoIbibo website shows that refund and the amounts shown are as below

The refund being shown is


- `₹1938` with RRN (Refund Reference Number) - `9748343df4434143887ffddd6dd9692717026401`
- `₹2794` with RRN (Refund Reference Number) - `21a7b1237199426184daf2fe2a495ff417029230`

Only refund breakup of the `₹1938` amount is being shown as depicted in the above image.

The total refund hence shown and also reflecting in my credit card (my mode of payment) is `₹1938 + ₹2794` = `₹4732`.


But I have paid `₹16576` in total for 4 tickets and 3 of them are cancelled. I was promised full refund with zero cancellation fees and only convenience fees of around `₹690` for 2 of the 3 cancelled tickets for `Shahedah Rayees` traveller and the 3rd cancelled ticket was the mistake of GoIbibo and the support agent `Ashish Kumar` who handled this.

Only after full assurance and multiple confirmations on call with the support agent `Ashish Kumar`, I agreed to book other tickets and he cancelled the tickets promising me multiple times that the tickets will be fully refunded.

Out of the paid amount `₹16576` I am only liable for 1 ticket's amount which should be around `₹4000` to `₹5000` apart from that all my money should be refunded because GoIbibo is fully responsible for this mishap as their support agent made mistakes and wrongly cancelled my tickets.

**Out of `₹16,576`, `₹5000` for the single ticket in the whole booking and `₹690` for the mentioned convenience charges which I abide with, should be deducted and I should get `₹16,576 - ₹5000 - ₹690` which should be around `₹10886` but instead I have gotten a refund of `₹4732` which is less that half of what I rightfully should get.**

### I have been wrongfully refunded less than half the money I am owed by GoIbibo. This is a pathetic experience for me. Apart from my money being withheld for so long and still not refunded, I have also been looted of hours of my time to call GoIbibo's support agents with no resolution in place. This is absolute robbery of a customer's hard earned money.

## GoIbibio should take full responsibility for their mistakes and refund me my rightful money or I will escalate this issue in every possible manner with every possible social media platform and consumer justice forums and the rightful courts till I get justice and my money.
